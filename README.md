# Overview

This is a store of LeetCode solutions I've created while self-studying through various coding languages. Focusing on syntax practice and //documentation with as much speed and memory optimization (when applicable) as I can muster.

I completed 35 examples across the first 9 days as I reaquainted myself with the syntax and basics of C++.

But I saw some flaws in my approach, which I've tried to detail below.

From here I'm starting in another direction, aiming for language and problem variety instead of quantity of problems solved.

Update: Java was moving much slower as I worked in other practice toward real job skills. Then the daily problem engine/picker broke and basically picked the same problem 4 times in a row (first 3 are the most recent Java solves).

With that annoyance, no great way to find the variety I want, and better job readiness coding exercises at my fingertips, I'm going to end this project.

# Lessons Learned
* Pace isn't as important as variety
  * Starting with Easy problems led them to quickly become repeditive
  * The daily promotoed challenges were the best part since they brought more nuance
  * Need to experiment with other ways to find differentiated problems
* Language choice should be fluid, and bias toward newer languages
  * C++ was too easy since I knew the basics already
  * Better options: Java, Ruby, Go, Swift
    * Would be ideal to determine the best language for the problem and add another vector of variety
  * May still integrate Python, Typescript, and/or C++ as "upkeep" solves
     * Perhaps as a thinking exercise for tougher problems before trying to rework into a new language
  * Syntax learning took a backseat to logic problem solving
     * There are better ways to practice the syntax anyway (technical interview prep)
