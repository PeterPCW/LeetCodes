This is a store of LeetCode solutions I've created while self-studying through various coding languages. I'm starting in the Easy difficulty and hoping to work through a few each day. Focusing on syntax practice and //documentation with as much speed and memory optimization as I can muster.

Starting with C++ and seeing where it goes from there!
